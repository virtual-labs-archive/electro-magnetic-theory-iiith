Theory:

When a structural system is subjected to alternating force then the system is said to be under-going forced vibration.
Examples of this type of vibration include a structure subjected to vibrating machines, vibration of a building during
an earthquake or under the action of wind, etc.

In forced vibration, the response of the structure not only depends the amplitude but also on the frequency of the applied force, however, the 
magnitude of the vibration response is strongly dependent on the behavior of the structural system. Usually in forced vibration we need to consider
the nature of the force and nature of the system. We are discussing here the forced vibrations of linear single degree of freedom systems.
